 **BACKGROUND**
I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Metallurgy and Materials Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur. I have experience working for INSPIRE Internship (Tata Steel Ltd, Jamshedpur; May'19 - Jul'19) and as a Business Operations Associate (ZS Associates Inc, Pune; Apr'21 - Jul'22). Currently, I am doing my Master's in Data Science at the Vellore Institute of Technology.

I am a passionate individual with a diverse range of hobbies: a book reader exploring new worlds, a ukulele and keyboard musician, a crochet artist creating unique pieces, and an animal rescuer dedicated to welfare work. My main aim in life is the optimisation of anything and everything and I try to incorporate it in my professional as well as personal interest.
